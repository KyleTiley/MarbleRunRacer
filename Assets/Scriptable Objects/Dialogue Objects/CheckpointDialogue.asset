  - 'Mentor: Welcome to the tracks rookie!'
  - 'Mentor: Are you ready to be the next marble racer champion?'
  - 'You: I sure hope so! But I''m not very familiar with racing or the rules...'
  - 'Mentor: Don''t you worry about that, that''s why I''m here.'
  - 'Mentor: Use WASD to move around the track, and the left mouse to look around.'
  - 'Mentor: Try not to bump into the sides of the track, it can slow you down.'
  - 'Mentor: But you can also slide along the edges to pass opponents...'
  - 'Mentor: Plus it can help you to keep momentum on the turns.'
  - 'Mentor: Now get out there and race!'
  - 'You: I''m ready!'
